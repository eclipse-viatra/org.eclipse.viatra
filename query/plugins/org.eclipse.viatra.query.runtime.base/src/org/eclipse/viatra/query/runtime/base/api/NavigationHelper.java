/**
 * 
 * Using an index of the EMF model, this interface exposes useful query functionality, such as:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Getting all the (direct or descendant) instances of a given {@link EClass}
 * <li>
 * Inverse navigation along arbitrary {@link EReference} instances (heterogenous paths too)
 * <li>
 * Finding model elements by attribute value (i.e. inverse navigation along {@link EAttribute})
 * <li>
 * Querying instances of given data types, or structural features.
 * </ul>
 * As queries are served from an index, results are always instantaneous.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Such indices will be built on an EMF model rooted at an {@link EObject}, {@link Resource} or {@link ResourceSet}. 
 * The boundaries of the model are defined by the containment (sub)tree.
 * The indices will be <strong>maintained incrementally</strong> on changes to the model; these updates can also be
 * observed by registering listeners.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * One of the options is to build indices in <em>wildcard mode</em>, meaning that all EClasses, EDataTypes, EReferences
 * and EAttributes are indexed. This is convenient, but comes at a high memory cost. To save memory, one can disable
 * <em>wildcard mode</em> and manually register those EClasses, EDataTypes, EReferences and EAttributes that should be
 * indexed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Another choice is whether to build indices in <em>dynamic EMF mode</em>, meaning that types are identified by the String IDs 
 * that are ultimately derived from the nsURI of the EPackage. Multiple types with the same ID are treated as the same.
 * This is useful if dynamic EMF is used, where there can be multiple copies (instantiations) of the same EPackage, 
 * representing essentially the same metamodel. If one disables <em>dynamic EMF mode</em>, an error is logged if 
 * duplicate EPackages with the same nsURI are encountered.
 * </p>
 *  
 * <p>
 * Note that none of the defined query methods return null upon empty result sets. All query methods return either a copy of
 * the result sets (where {@link Setting} is instantiated) or an unmodifiable collection of the result view.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Instantiate using {@link ViatraBaseFactory}
