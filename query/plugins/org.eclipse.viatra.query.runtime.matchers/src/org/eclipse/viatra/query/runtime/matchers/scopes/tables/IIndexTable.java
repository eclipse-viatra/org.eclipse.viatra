/**
 * Read-only interface that provides the {@link IInputKey}-specific slice of an instance store to realize a
 * {@link IQueryRuntimeContext}. Implemented by a customizable data store that is responsible for:
 * <ul>
 * <li>storing the instance tuples of the {@link IInputKey},</li>
 * <li>providing efficient lookup via storage-specific indexing,</li>
 * <li>delivering notifications. (TODO not designed yet)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Can be specialized for unary / binary / etc., opposite edges or node subtypes, specific types, distributed storage,
 * etc.
 * <p>
 * Writeable API is specific to the customized implementations (e.g. unary).
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Precondition:</b> the associated input key is enumerable, see {@link IQueryMetaContext#isEnumerable(IInputKey)}.
 * <p>
 * <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong>. This class or interface has been added as
 * part of a work in progress. There is no guarantee that this API will
 * work or that it will remain the same.
 *
 * @since 2.0
 * @author Gabor Bergmann
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented directly. Extend {@link AbstractIndexTable} instead.
