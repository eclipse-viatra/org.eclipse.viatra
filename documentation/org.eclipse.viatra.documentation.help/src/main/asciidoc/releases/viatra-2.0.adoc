= VIATRA 2.0

== New and Noteworthy

=== New Language Features

VIATRA 2.0 introduces a new aggregator for calculating the average of numbers in matches. As an example, the following pattern can be used to calculate the average number of CPU values over a set of instances.

[source,vql]
----
pattern avgCPU(n : java Double) {
    n == avg find availableCPU(_, #v);
}

private pattern availableCPU(host : HostInstance, value : java Integer) {
	HostInstance.availableCpu(host, value);
}
----

=== Query Editing

Hover help support was enhanced in VIATRA 2.0, specifically, a lot of elements now display hover that previously did not, including EClass and EReference types and variable references. Furthermore, calculating these hovers should be more efficient now, resulting in better performance in case of large number of patterns and/or complex metamodel hierarchies.

== Migrating to VIATRA 2.0

=== Dependency updates
Update minimum version of required dependencies 

=== Code generator updates

In VIATRA 2.0, the default behavior of query code generator was updated to reduce the number of generated files. This means, no `.util` package is generated, match and matcher code is generated as embedded subclasses, and match processors are not generated anymore.
 
If necessary, the old generator behavior can be set by relying on the VQL Compiler settings.

=== Deprecated code removal

All code marked as deprecated has been removed from the codebase. Additionally, further components were removed

* CEP has been removed
* Xcore integration has been removed
* C++ local search implementatation has been removed
* Query-by-example has been removed
* EVM-JDT integration has been removed


=== Removal of EMF-independent pattern language project

VIATRA 2.0 removes support for query languages not relying on EMF metamodels but retaining the structure of the VQL language. This feature is not used at all, but increases language maintenance costs significantly. Most users of the VIATRA framework should not be affected at all, but all related API changes are listed below.

 * The projects `org.eclipse.viatra.patternlanguage`, `org.eclipse.viatra.patternlanguage.ui` and `org.eclipse.viatra.patternlanguage.tests` were merged with their EMF-specific counterparts, respectively `org.eclipse.viatra.patternlanguage.emf`, `org.eclipse.viatra.patternlanguage.emf.ui` and `org.eclipse.viatra.patternlanguage.emf.tests`.
 * The EMF models representing the ASTs have been merged into a simple EMF model, and moved to a new package:
   * The metamodel is available with the nsURI of `http://www.eclipse.org/viatra/query/patternlanguage/emf/PatternLanguage`
   * All generated classes are available from the package `org.eclipse.viatra.query.patternlanguage.emf.vql`
   * The generated class structure is the same as previous versions.
 * The extensions `org.eclipse.viatra.patternlanguage.annotations` and `org.eclipse.viatra.patternlanguage.whitelist` was moved into the patternlanguage.emf project, thus it's IDs were updated to `org.eclipse.viatra.patternlanguage.emf.annotations` and `org.eclipse.viatra.patternlanguage.emf.whitelist`, respectively.
 * The classes `CorePatternLanguageHelper` and `EMFPatternLanguageHelper` were merged into a shared `PatternLanguageHelper` class.

=== Reduction of Guava uses

There were a few cases, where Guava types such as Functions or Predicates were visible in the API. In VIATRA 2.0, the trivial method calls were removed (to be handled via direct method references), while the remaining ones were replaced by the alternatives built-in to the Java 8 standard library. The following classes and methods were affected:

 * `PQueries#parameterDirectionPredicate`: returns Java 8 predicate
 * `PQueries#queryNameFunction`: can be replaced by a method reference of `PQuery::getFullyQualifiedName`
 * `PQueries#parameterNameFunction`: can be replaced by a method reference of `PParameter::getName`
 * `PQueries#queryOfReferenceFunction`: can be replaced by a method reference of `IQueryReference::getReferredQuery`
 * `PQueries#directlyReferencedQueriesFunction`: returns a Java 8 function
 * `PQueries#queryStatusPredicate`: returns a Java 8 predicate
 * `CorePatternLanguageHelper#getReferencedPatternsTransitive` accepts a Java 8 predicate as a parameter
 * `ConflictSetIterator` accepts a Java 8 predicate as a constructor parameter
 * `BatchTransformationStatements#fireUntil` accepts a Java 8 predicate as a condition
 * `RecordingJob` does not record all created commands in a Table anymore; if the created commands are to be accessed, the RecordingJob should be initialized with a new command recorder instance that will be notified with each command after it was executed
 * The `QueryResultMultimap` and `EVMBasedQueryResultMultimap` classes provided a Multimap interface for query matches; given they limited uses through the years, were simply removed.


=== Removal of unnecessary Xtend library dependencies

The transformation API used the `Pair` class from the Xtend standard library to rely the `->` (mapped to) operator to define filters based on name mappings. In version 2.0, the underlying code was changed to rely on `Map.Entry` classes from the Java standard library. 

The following methods were affected by this change:

* `MatchParameterFilter` accepts an array of Map Entries instead of Xtend Pairs
* `BatchTransformationStatements` accepts an array of Map Entries instead of Xtend Pairs as parameters on various methods
* `EventDrivenTransformationBuilder#filter` accepts an array of Map Entries instead of Xtend Pairs

To migrate your code, you can do one of the following:

*Â If you are using Xtend code, and the `"name" -> value` syntax does not compile anymore, add the following import declaration in the header: `import static extension org.eclipse.viatra.transformation.runtime.emf.transformation.TransformationExtensions.*`
* If you are not using Xtend, or you don't want to rely on the mapped to operator, simply instantiate these entries with the call `new SimpleEntry<>("name", value)`.

=== Avoid returning null values in the API

A few APIs in VIATRA returned null if no possible values could be found. Given VIATRA 2.0 depends on Java 8, such APIs were reworked to return link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html[Optional] values instead.

The affected methods are the following:

 * PQueryHeader#getFirstAnnotationByName
 * CorePatternLanguageHelper#getFirstAnnotationByName
 * CorePatternLanguageHelper#getParameterByName
 * ViatraQueryMatcher#getOneArbitraryMatch

If the old behavior of returning `null` values is necessary the `Optional.orElse` call can be used, e.g. `query.getFirstAnnotationByName("Constraint").orElse(null);`

=== Exception handling consolidation
Before VIATRA 2.0, the various APIs of the Query component threw a set of different *checked* exceptions: ViatraQueryException, ViatraBaseException and QueryProcessingException (and specialized versions of them). For version 2.0, these exceptions were updated in two ways:

1. All of them are now runtime exceptions, making it unnecessary to explicitly catch them. This makes it easier to put query processing code into lambda expressions, however, makes it entirely the developers responsibility to handle these exceptions as they happen.
2. All of them have now a common base exception called ViatraQueryRuntimeException - this class can be used anywhere in catch blocks if appropriate.
