= Maven integration

VIATRA Query supports building VIATRA Query projects in a Maven-based builds by generating the pattern matcher code from the vql files.

.Requirements
* The maven compiler requires Maven 3.1 to function correctly. In some cases Maven 3.0.5 is enough, but there are some dependency issues that are problematic for this version. Versions before Maven 3.0 will not work at all. See http://bugs.eclipse.org/478437 for details.

.Known limitations
* Code generation for integration components (e.g. validation framework, derived features) is not supported. See http://bugs.eclipse.org/434794
* The VIATRA Query project is not available from Maven Central, only from repo.eclipse.org.
* There is no maven archetype support: it is not possible to generate an Eclipse-less project automatically, that works with VIATRA Query. However, manually created projects can be built with the existing compiler.

== Repository

Maven components are available from the Eclipse maven repository with the following urls:

 * Releases: https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/viatra-releases/ (kept indefinitely)
 * Snapshot only: http://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/viatra-snapshots/ (cleared after 30 days)
Â * Combined repository: https://repo.eclipse.org/content/groups/viatra/

The following maven projects are available for use:

org.eclipse.viatra:viatra-query-runtime:: dependency for the VIATRA Query runtime, without support for generic API
org.eclipse.viatra:viatra-query-language:: dependency for the VIATRA Query with support for generic API (requires many more dependencies - only use if required)
org.eclipse.viatra:viatra-maven-plugin:: Maven code generator, should not be added to the compile classpath

To use VIATRA Query features, add the repository and the required dependencies to your Maven project:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- use this in your project's pom.xml file -->
<properties>
    <!-- It is a good idea to specify VIATRA framework version once as
    a property (e.g. in the parent pom) and use that throughout the build -->
	<viatra.version>1.2.1</viatra.version>
</properties>

	<dependency>

== viatra-maven-plugin

The maven plugin requires information from the used EMF packages and additionally the EMF packages should be able loaded as well. For this reason, it is important to add references to EPackages and Genmodels together with the corresponding dependencies.

Since 1.5, it is possible to use the project dependencies without declaring them explicitly. This helps when the metamodels you are using are not available as Maven artifacts.

.Additional notes
* Package reference is added either by file path to the .genmodel file (typically by platform:/resource URI) or fully qualified name of the Ecore Package class that is available on the classpath. Note that if the class is in the same plugin as the query file, the class based reference will not work as compilation will happen at a later build phase than the generation. Also pay attention not to mix the package class-based and the genmodel-based mechanism in one reactor because it can lead to strange errors.
* Each package that is imported must be listed in the metamodels section. The packages that are used transitively by the explicitly listed packages do not need to be listed.
* Explicit dependency declarations are transitive, so you don't need to specify all dependencies in all POM.XML files. Note that in some cases you need to add extra dependencies with specific versions (e.g. emf.core) if your genmodel requires a higher version than what is provided by the viatra-maven-plugin. This way you can redefine the EMF versions used by the generator.
* If a pattern file in a Maven project imports patterns from another project on which it depends, make sure that the files containing the imported patterns are included in the dependency's Maven artifact.

=== Language extension support

Starting with VIATRA 2.0, the viatra-maven-compiler can understand custom annotations, and validate them. To support these features, the new `viatra-query-language-extensions` maven module has to be added to the dependencies of the project.

NOTE: Code generator features bound to annotations, e.g. in case of the validation framework or the query-based derived feature support are still not available in the Maven compiler.

=== Troubleshooting

.Cyclic linking
In a project that contains multiple pattern definition files, there is a slight chance you get an error message like follows:

`ERROR:Cyclic linking detected : PatternCall.patternRef->PatternCall.patternRef`

This is a known issue we are working to fix; see http://bugs.eclipse.org/464120 and http://bugs.eclipse.org/480652 for details about the underlying issues.

As workaround, we suggest to explicitly define types for all parameters, because that avoids this issue. If that is not enough, you have to ensure that the vql files are processed in calling order: all patterns are to be processed before they are used in a pattern call. This can be achieved either by moving patterns between vql files, or by renaming your .vql files so that the files that call patterns from other files should have names lexicographically greater than the referenced files. 

For example, let's suppose that you have a query file with two queries:

[source,vql]
----
// util.vql

pattern utilityPattern(...) {
  find anotherUtilityPattern(...);
}

pattern anotherUtilityPattern(...) {
  ...
}
----

The cyclic linking occurs where `utilityPattern` calls `anotherUtilityPattern`. Search for callers of `utilityPattern`! Let's suppose it is in this file:

[source,vql]
----
// logic.vql

pattern myPattern(...) {
  find utilityPattern(...);
}
----

You have to rename `util.vql` to `a_util.vql` and `logic.vql` to `b_logic.vql`, so that the former is processed before the latter.

.Ambiguous types

If you get type errors during validation such as `ERROR:foo cannot be resolved.` or `ERROR:Ambiguous variable type defintions: [Foo, Bar], type cannot be selected` although the query files are valid in Eclipse, check the cross-references in your ecore/genmodel files by opening them with a text editor. If their URIs are workspace-based, i.e. they start with `platform:/resource`, you have to map those URIs to absolute `file:` URIs by including URI mappings in the viatra-maven-plugin configuration (since 1.6):

[source,vql]
----
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.eclipse.viatra</groupId>
	<artifactId>viatra-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	<configuration>
...
		<uriMappings>
			<uriMapping>
				<sourceUri>platform:/resource/school/model/school.ecore</sourceUri>
				<targetUri>file:/${project.basedir}/school/model/school.ecore</targetUri>
			</uriMapping>
			<uriMapping>
				<sourceUri>platform:/resource/school/model/school.genmodel</sourceUri>
				<targetUri>file:/${project.basedir}/school/model/school.genmodel</targetUri>
			</uriMapping>
		</uriMappings>
	</configuration>
</plugin>
----

.Multiple definitions of a type

If you get the error
`ERROR:Variable foo has a type Foo which has multiple definitions: 'file://C:\project\model/../../anotherProject/model/usedMetamodel.ecore' --  'file://C:\project\../anotherProject/model/usedMetamodel.ecore'`
make sure that the genmodelUri in the viatra-maven-plugin's configuration is *exactly* the same as the URI in your .genmodel file, e.g. if your `metamodel.ecore` resides in the `model` subfolder, this will be the configuration with the correct relative URI:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.eclipse.viatra</groupId>
	<artifactId>viatra-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	<configuration>
		<metamodels>
			<metamodel>
				<genmodelUri>model/../../anotherProject/model/usedMetamodel.genmodel</genmodelUri>
			</metamodel>
		</metamodels>
	</configuration>
</plugin>
----

NOTE: The URIs should be the same *after* URI mapping if used.
