:experimental:

Constraints and conditions in the VIATRA framework are expressed using a graph pattern-based language. This declarative formalism allows very compact definitions of complex conditions, while it is still possible to provide live query evaluation based on the Rete algorithm.

In the following we get an overview of the query development environment, starting with the definition of queries, followed by query evaluation support. Then we gain an understanding of the various language elements by creating more and more complex queries.

A graph pattern encodes a _named_ query with some _parameters_ defined as a _disjunction_ of pattern _bodies_, while each body consists of a _set_ of constraints.  The result of a graph pattern, called _match set_, is a _set_ of (model element) tuples where the elements fulfill all constraints defined in at least one of the pattern bodies.

NOTE: The pattern language always works on sets: neither the constraints nor the match set is ordered; and match set never includes multiple tuples with exactly the same model elements.

== Define your First Query
To define queries, first a  _VIATRA Query Project_ has to be created with the standard _New Project Wizard_ of Eclipse. Such projects are specialized Eclipse plug-in projects with preconfigured VIATRA dependencies and the query generator initialized. Query specifications have to be added to the Java classpath of the projects, more specifically into Java packages. Based on these observations the creation of the first query consists of the following steps:

. Create a new VIATRA Query project in the host Eclipse with any name. The tutorial will assume the following name: `org.eclipse.viatra.examples.cps.queries`.
. Add `org.eclipse.viatra.examples.cps.model` to the Plug-in dependencies to make the CPS metamodel available for the project.
. Create a Java package to store the queries. The tutorial will assume one named `org.eclipse.viatra.examples.cps.queries`.
. Create a new query definition in a package named using the `New Query Definition` wizard from the VIATRA category. The tutorial assumes the query file is named `CPSQueries.vql`.
. Fill the first query:

// Java package declaration, must match the container of the file
package org.eclipse.viatra.examples.cps.queries

import "http://org.eclipse.viatra/model/cps"

include::../../../../../org.eclipse.viatra.documentation.example/src/org/eclipse/viatra/documentation/example/queries/CPSQueries.vql[tag=hostIpAddress]
----

Looking at the pattern header, we see that this pattern has two parameters, meaning its results will be a pair of values, the first selecting a `HostInstance` from the model, while the second one a `String` literal. The connection between these elements is described by a single constraint ensuring that `ip` variable stores the `nodeIp` attribute of a corresponding `HostInstance`.

== Evaluate Queries in the Query Results View

VIATRA includes a view to evaluate the results of queries over various editors, and reacts on changes in the editor.

The *Query Results* view is the primary tool for debugging graph patterns. Open the view by selecting _Window/Show View/Query Results_ or you can simply press the kbd:[CTRL+3] shortcut and start to type the name of the view. The view allows loading models and queries, and display (and update) the results of queries automatically. Together with the installed metamodels there is also an example instance model included that will be used in this tutorial as an example.

.Initialize the example CPS demonstrator project
image::tutorial/generate_cps_example.png[Generate CPS example]

. Open our example instance model (/org.eclipse.viatra.examples.cps.instances/example.cyberphysicalsystem)
. Make sure "ReteEngine" is selected in the toolbar of the Query Results view
. then press the 'Load model from active editor' (first button on the toolbar)
. Open the query specification (vql file)
. then press the 'Load queries from the active editor' button

At this point the _Query Results_ view should contain the matches of the freshly created pattern. Using the example model, you can see that there are 6 matches for the pattern, each consisting of a HostInstance-IP address pair. Note that the _Query Results_ view provides live results: by updating the model in the model editor file, e.g. adding a new host instance or changing its IP address, the results update automatically.

.Query Results View
image::tutorial/queryresultview.png[Query Results View in Action]

NOTE: If the 'Load model from active editor' button is not enabled, it either means, the current editor does not contain a model, or VIATRA does not understand the editor type. By default, EMF tree editors are supported; other editor types, such as graphical editors are supported by additional integration plug-ins, such as the GMF or Graphiti integration available from the VIATRA repository.

== Define Additional Queries

In the following, we define a set of patterns that illustrate additional capabilities of the query language. Each pattern will come with a short definition, followed by the code itself and some remarks about how the pattern works.

. List all `HostInstance` elements whose IP address is an empty string
* This pattern, similar to the first pattern, still consists of a single constraint. The pattern constraints can refer to Java literals, like empty strings or numbers directly.
* Notice that if you create a new `HostInstance` element, it will not appear in the match results. This happens because in EMF unset and empty attributes are different (similar to the difference between empty Strings and null in Java). You can write a pattern that finds missing attribute values using the `neg find` construct (see later).

----
+

. List all `HostInstance`-`HostInstance` pairs that share a common IP address
* This pattern is more complex, as it has three parameters and three constraints. The first two describe similar type constraints we have seen. The pattern also compares the values of variables `host1` and `host2` with each other using the `!=` (_not equal_) operator (The `==` operator is also available).

include::../../../../../org.eclipse.viatra.documentation.example/src/org/eclipse/viatra/documentation/example/queries/CPSQueries.vql[tag=sameIpAddress]
----
+

. List all `HostInstance` elements that have non well-formed IPv4 addresses (e.g. not four numbers separated with dots)
* The well-formedness validation of the IP address strings requires specific validation blocks called `check` expressions where  you can write a wide range of _Xbase_ expressions, behaving similarly to Java and accessing Java classes from the classpath of the project. In this case, the well-formedness of the address values is represented with a regular expression evaluation.
* It is important to note that check expressions *have to* be side-effect free and can only be called on attribute variables.

----
+

. List `State` elements connected through `Transition` elements
* A pattern body might use variables other than the pattern parameters, such as the variable `transition` in this example. These variables are called local variables.
* It is important to note that if there are multiple transitions between two states, the match set will still include only a single pair of the states, because local variables are not included in the match tuples. If all edges are required, the corresponding transition variable should also be declared as a parameter.

----
+

. List bad host instances that fail either of the previous conditions.
* Disjunctions can be expressed by using the `or` keyword between pattern bodies. A model element tuple is included in the match set of a pattern, if at least one of the bodies have a match. Note that if multiple bodies would match the same tuple, the match set of the pattern will still only include the tuple once (_set semantics_).
* Patterns can be reused using `find` constraints meaning all conditions expressed by the called pattern must be matched from the source.
* This pattern also includes _single-use_ (or don't care) variables, starting with the character '_'. Such a declaration describes a variable where we are only interested in its existence but not its value.

include::../../../../../org.eclipse.viatra.documentation.example/src/org/eclipse/viatra/documentation/example/queries/CPSQueries.vql[tag=badHost]
----
+

. List all good host instances (that meet neither of the incorrect conditions)
* The negative pattern composition, expressed by the `neg find` keyword is used to define negative conditions. This works similar to the `find` constraints, with the notable exception that if there are any matches to the badHost with the selected parameters, the host pattern fails to match.
* Those actual parameters of the negative pattern call that are not used elsewhere in the calling body are _universally quantified_, meaning that the calling pattern only matches if variables of the calling pattern cannot be bound to matching elements.

----
+

. List the number of applications for each HostInstance
* Patterns can be marked as private, making the pattern itself only visible inside the source file it is defined. The generated code for these patterns is reduced (e.g. does not include generated Match and Matcher classes for easier access).
* It is possible to calculate the matches of a pattern using the `count find` expressions. The value of such an expression is the number of matches found with the selected number of matches.

== Validation

VIATRA provides facilities to create validation rules based on the pattern language of the framework. These rules can be evaluated on various EMF instance models and upon violations of constraints, markers are automatically created in the Eclipse Problems View. 

The *@Constraint* annotation can be used to derive a validation rule from a graph pattern as a validation rule. The pattern of the rule identifies the erroneous model elements, while the annotation parameters provides information about how to present the results in the user interface. The annotation uses the following parameters:

* _key:_ The list of paremeters which determine which objects the constraint violation needs to be attached to.
* _message:_ The message to display when the constraint violation is found. The message may refer the parameter variables between $ symbols, or their EMF features, such as in $Param1.name$.
* _severity:_ "warning" or "error"
* _targetEditorId:_ An Eclipse editor ID where the validation framework should register itself to the context menu. Use ` * ` as a wildcard if the constraint should be used always when validation is started.

NOTE: To find a specific editor id, we can use the _Plug-in Selection Spy_ tool with a kbd:[Shift+Alt+F1] shortcut. For a few generic editors, such as the *Sample Reflective Ecore Editor*, the framework by default provides such a registration option, no manual registration is necessary. 

For example:

[[vql-constraint]]
[source,vql]
----
@Constraint(targetEditorId = "org.eclipse.viatra.examples.cps.cyberPhysicalSystem.presentation.CyberPhysicalSystemEditorID",
            severity = "error",
            message = "The ip address is not unique",
            key = {host1})
pattern sameIpAddress(host1: HostInstance, host2: HostInstance, commonIp : java String) {
    HostInstance.nodeIp(host1, commonIp);
    HostInstance.nodeIp(host2, commonIp);
    host1!=host2;
}
----

When adding such a constraint annotation to a graph pattern, the code generator initializes a validation project that includes and registers the rules derived from the patterns for the framework. These rules can be tried out by opening a new runtime Eclipse instance:

* Launch a new `Eclipse application` containing all projects in the workspace.
* In the newly launched Eclipse instance, open an erroneous instance model in the model editor (make sure the editor is the same one that is added to the `targetEditorId` parameter).
* Start the validation from the popup menu items under *VIATRA Validation*.

== More Complex Queries

This section introduces a set of more complex queries, useful for both introducing the remaining language features such as aggregators while illustrating the way the query language allows breaking down more complex conditions.

=== Calculate the Maximum Number of Instances

It is possible to find the Application Type that has the most instances defined in the model by combining a _counting_ of the values of the related feature and a _max_ function.  The `sumNumberOfInstances` helper pattern uses a `count` call of the `ApplicationType.instances` feature (note the omission of the `find` keyword there). This feature is available starting with VIATRA 2.0, and allows reducing the number of trivial helper patterns, like the pattern `hostIpAddress` introduced earlier in this tutorial.

After the counts are available in the match set of a pattern, it is easy to calculate the maximum value using the `max find` construct.

include::../../../../../org.eclipse.viatra.documentation.example/src/org/eclipse/viatra/documentation/example/queries/CPSQueries.vql[tag=maximumNumberOfInstances]
----

=== Check Memory Requirements of a Host

The CPS metamodel explicitly stores requirements of applications, and both free and total resource values in case of host instances. However, checking that application requirements and free and total values are consistent requires checking.

.Requirement handling in the metamodel
image::tutorial/cps_resources.png[Requirements in the CPS Metamodel]

In the following example we focus on the memory requirements, but similar queries can be provided for CPU or HDD requirements. The well-formedness constraint we are trying to enforce is as follows: `FREE MEMORY + SUM(MEMORY OF DEPLOYED APPLICATIONS) = TOTAL MEMORY`.

The pattern requires two helper patterns: one of them (`applicationTypeRequirementRAM`) is responsible for collecting the RAM requirement for a selected `Application Type`, the other (`totalMemoryRequirements`) summarizes all memory requirements a selected application instance.

Using these helper patterns, the `invalidMemoryRequirement` pattern executes two additional steps: (1) it _summarizes_ the results of the pattern `totalMemoryRequirements` with regards to the application instances allocated to a host instance, and (2) _checks_ whether the three requirements are consistent.

NOTE: A Host Instance is allocated to at most a single application, so it is not required to summarize the requirements of all applications here as done in the `invalidMemoryRequirement` pattern. However, adding this element to the query illustrates how to use `sum` correctly if multiple levels of summarization is necessary.
