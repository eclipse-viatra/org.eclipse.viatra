= Setting up the tutorial

This tutorial was last updated using VIATRA 2.3.0 (released on 18th December 2019), available from the Simultaneous Release Train p2 repository (http://download.eclipse.org/releases/2019-12). The latest version can be downloaded from http://download.eclipse.org/viatra/updates/release/latest that should be compatible with everything described here. To install VIATRA, select the `VIATRA Query and Transformation SDK` from the selected repository to install.

This document assumes that the CPS metamodels are installed into the Eclipse instance. They are available from the p2 repository http://download.eclipse.org/viatra/examples/cps

VIATRA defines a custom perspective called `Transformation Development` that includes a few views and shortcuts that make it easier to develop queries and transformations. The remainder of the tutorial expects that this perspective is selected; in case a different perspective is used, the corresponding views and wizards are still available in their standard respective locations.
