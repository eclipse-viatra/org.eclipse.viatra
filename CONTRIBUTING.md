# Contributing to Eclipse VIATRA

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The Eclipse VIATRA framework supports the development of model transformations
with specific focus on event-driven, reactive transformations. Building upon the
incremental query support, VIATRA offers a language to define transformations
and a reactive transformation engine to execute certain transformations upon
changes in the underlying model.
